# AsyncAPI tck
AsyncAPI's Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) provides a way for AsyncAPI processors to test their level of compliance with the specification. This TCK contains a set of AsyncAPI documents meant to be used to test correct and incorrect usage of each AsyncAPI feature.

The TCK is build for version >=2.0.0.
