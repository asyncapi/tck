# AsyncAPI tck

AsyncAPI's Test Compatibility Kit (AsyncAPI TCK) provides a way for any AsyncAPI processor to test its compliance with the AsyncAPI 2.0 Spec. AsyncAPI TCK contains a set of AsyncAPI documents meant to be used to test correct and incorrect usage of each AsyncAPI feature.

## Naming convention

- `*valid*.yaml`: valid AsyncAPI file expected to be successfully processed
- `*invalid*.yaml`: invalid AsyncAPI file with syntax/semantic/spec error(s), expected to be unsuccessfully processed (error or exit code returned)

Note that this repository contains a [manifest file](./manifest.json) that lists all tests in the order their respective tested features appear in the AsyncAPI 2.0 Specification.

Names of folders' tests reside in correspond to AsyncAPI 2.0 Specification sections names.

Non-AsyncAPI files (libraries, extensions, etc.) must have a `.yml` extension instead of `.yaml`.
