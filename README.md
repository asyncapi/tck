# AsyncAPI tck
AsyncAPI's Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) provides a way for AsyncAPI processors to test their level of compliance with the [AsyncAPI 2.0 Spec](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/versions/2.0.0/asyncapi.md). This TCK contains a set of AsyncAPI documents meant to be used to test correct and incorrect usage of each AsyncAPI feature.
